Setting Up Sphinx on Windows for Python Files

1. Install Python and Pip

Make sure you have Python and pip (Python's package installer) installed. 
You can download Python from python.org and follow the installation instructions. 
Ensure that you check the box to add Python to your system PATH during installation.

2. Install Sphinx
Open Command Prompt and install Sphinx using pip:

> pip install sphinx

3. Create a Documentation Directory

Navigate to your project directory or create a new one for your documentation:

> mkdir docs
> cd docs

4. Initialise Sphinx

Run the sphinx-quickstart command in the terminal to generate the initial configuration files:

> sphinx-quickstart

You will be prompted to answer a series of questions to configure your documentation. 
For a simple setup, you can accept the default options or provide your specific details.

5. Configure Sphinx

Open the conf.py file located in the docs/source directory. This is the configuration file for Sphinx. 
Update it to include the path to your Python modules. 

--> Add your project path to sys.path:

import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../your_python_module_directory'))

Replace your_python_module_directory with the relative path to your Python module from the docs directory.

6. Generate Documentation for Your Python Files

You need to use autodoc extension to automatically generate documentation from docstrings in your Python files. 

Ensure that extensions list in conf.py includes sphinx.ext.autodoc:

extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']

7. Create .rst Files

--> Create reStructuredText files in the docs/source directory to organize your documentation. 

For example, you can create index.rst which will serve as the main entry point:

.. YourProject documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Fri Sep 14 2024.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to YourProject's documentation!
=======================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   modules

--> Create another file, modules.rst, to include information about your modules:

YourProject Modules
====================

.. automodule:: your_module_name
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   
--> Replace your_module_name with the actual name of your module.

8. Build the Documentation

--> Navigate back to the docs directory and build the documentation using:

make html

This command will generate HTML files in the _build/html directory inside the docs directory. 
Open index.html in a web browser to view your documentation.

9. Updating Documentation

Each time you update your Python code or documentation files, 
rerun the make html command to regenerate the documentation.

Summary
1. Install Python and pip.
2. Install Sphinx with pip install sphinx.
3. Initialise Sphinx with sphinx-quickstart.
4. Configure conf.py for your project.
5. Use autodoc to document your code.
6. Create and edit .rst files for your content.
7. Build the documentation with make html.
8. Open the generated HTML files to view the documentation.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up a basic documentation system using Sphinx for your Python project on Windows.
