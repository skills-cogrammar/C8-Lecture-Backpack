"""     ========= Design Scenario =========
Design a simple Library System for a local library. 
The system should allow librarians to manage book inventory, 
handle borrowing and returning books, and keep track of library members.
"""

"""     -------- Class Diagram --------
•	Design a Class Diagram to represent the structure of the Library System.
    •	Identify classes such as Library, Book, Member, Librarian, BorrowingRecord, 
        and any other relevant entities.
    •	Define attributes and methods for each class.
    •	Consider simple relationships like 
        aggregation (e.g., a Member borrows Books) and 
        association (e.g., a Librarian manages Books).
    •	Provide a brief description explaining the purpose of each class 
        and its role in the Library System.

        -- Class Descriptions:

Library: Represents a library entity with attributes like 
name, address, and a list of books it contains.

Librarian: Represents a librarian entity with attributes like 
name and employee ID. Manages books within the library.

Book: Represents a book entity with attributes like 
title, author, ISBN, genre, and availability status.

Member: Represents a library member entity with attributes like 
name, contact information, and a list of borrowed books.

BorrowingRecord: Represents a borrowing record entity with attributes like 
the book borrowed, the member borrowing it, and the due date.

        -- Relationships:

Librarian-Manages-Book: Represents the 
*association* between a librarian and the books they manage.

Library-Manages-Book: Represents the 
*aggregation* between a library and the books it contains.
Use a hollow diamond shape on the containing class (e.g., Library) 
pointing towards the contained class (e.g., Book)
Label the diamond with a multiplicity (e.g., "0..*")

Member-Borrows-Book: Represents the 
*association* between a member and the books they borrow.

Book-BorrowingRecord: Represents the 
*association* between a book and its borrowing records.

        -- The Diagram: Note - See draw.io file for a better visual

The + and - symbols represent the visibility or access level of 
a class's attributes and methods. They indicate whether other 
parts of the program can access or use these elements.

+ (Plus sign): This indicates that the attribute or method is PUBLIC, 
meaning it can be accessed from outside the class. 

- (Minus sign): This indicates that the attribute or method is PRIVATE, 
meaning it can only be accessed within the class itself.
"""

"""     -------- CRUD Matrix --------
•	Create a CRUD Matrix to outline the CRUD operations 
    for each class in your Class Diagram. You can use any spreadsheet like
    (MS-Excel, Google Sheets) software.
    to do this.
•	Specify the Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations 
    for classes like Book, Member, and BorrowingRecord.
•	Consider who has permission to perform each operation 
    (e.g., Librarian can add, update, and delete Books, 
    while Members can only read and borrow Books).
•	Provide justification for the access permissions assigned to each operation.
