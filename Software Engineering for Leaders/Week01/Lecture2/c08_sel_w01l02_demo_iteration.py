# ============= While loop Examples
 
# Example 1 - Printing a count up to 4
count = 1

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    # count += 1
    count = count + 1

"""
This while loop continues to execute as long as the condition (count <= 5) 
is true, illustrating how a while loop can repeatedly execute a block of code.
"""
# Example 2 - Counting down from 5
count = 5

while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
print("takeoff!")

# Example 3: Menu example

# Initialise the choice variable
choice = ""

# Continue looping until the user chooses to exit
while choice != "3":
    # Display the menu
    print("\nMenu:")
    print("1. Say Hello")
    print("2. Calculate Sum")
    print("3. Exit")

    # Get the user's choice - NOTE: input is always of type string
    choice = input("Please choose an option (1-3): ")

    # Process the user's choice
    if choice == '1':
        print("Hello!")
    elif choice == '2':
        # Calculate the sum of two numbers
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
        print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}")
    elif choice == '3':
        print("Exiting the program. Goodbye!")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")


# ============= For loop Examples

# Example 1

""" 
This for loop iterates over each element in the fruits list and prints it, 
demonstrating the use of iteration to automate repetitive tasks.

matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

Trace Table:

|-----------|-------|-----------|

The trace table tracks the values of i and total after each loop iteration 
to debug and verify loop logic.
